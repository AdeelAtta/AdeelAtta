- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AdeelAtta

As a Software Engineer, I create websites that are robust, responsive, and visually appealing, using MERN stack (HTML, CSS, JS, React, Nodejs, express and Mongodb ) I have developed multiple web projects, following best practices and standards for web development. For instance, I recently worked on a website for a blockchain enthusiast, implementing authentication, display dynamic content, API's Integrations focusing on writing scalable, efficient & clean code using design patterns, code patterns, Data structure and many more.

I'm eager to learn and grow, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge on Generative AI for participating in hackathons. My goal is to utilize my programming, structured data & Algorithm skills on Discovering practical Use Cases by utilizing existing models.
